              If it becomes necessary to add a feature to unclear code,
              refactoring it makes things obvious for you and those coming after
              you.

              <strong> Refactoring makes it easier to add features.</strong> New
              features are added more smoothly and with less effort.

          <p class="block__p">
            Bugs resemble cockroaches: they love to live in the darkest,
            mustiest places of your code. Clean up your code and the errors will
            practically find themselves.
          </p>
          <p class="block__p">
            Managers appreciate proactive refactoring, since it eliminates the
            need to create special refactoring tasks later. Happy bosses mean
            happy programmers!

            Review may be your last chance to tidy up your code before it
            becomes available to the public.
          </p>
          <p class="block__p">
            The best way to review is together with the author of the code. You
            propose changes and decide, together with the author, how difficult
            it will be to implement various refactoring techniques. Small
            changes can be made right on the spot.
